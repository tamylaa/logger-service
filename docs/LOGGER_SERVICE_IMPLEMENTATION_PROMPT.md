2. **Scalability Impact:**
   - How will you optimize log processing for high throughput?
   - What queuing mechanisms will handle traffic spikes?
   - How will you implement efficient storage operations?
   - What caching strategies will reduce database load?

3. **Integration Impact:**
   - How will you implement seamless API communication with existing services?
   - What error handling will ensure graceful degradation?
   - How will you maintain backward compatibility during updates?
   - What testing will validate cross-service interactions?

4. **Intelligence Impact:**
   - How will you implement real-time categorization algorithms?
   - What machine learning models will detect anomalies?
   - How will you generate actionable insights from log patterns?
   - What automated responses will trigger based on severity?

5. **Code Quality Impact:**
   - How will you ensure consistent code patterns across the service?
   - What testing strategies will validate all features?
   - How will you implement proper error handling and logging?
   - What documentation will support maintenance and updates?
