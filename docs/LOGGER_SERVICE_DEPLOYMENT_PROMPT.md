# Deployment Phase Prompt

**Prompt Title:** Secure and Scalable Logger Service Deployment Strategy

**Objective:** Deploy the logger service across multiple environments with zero-downtime, ensuring high availability, security, and performance while maintaining integration with existing Tamyla infrastructure.

**Multi-Impact Considerations:**

1. **Security Impact:**
   - How will you secure deployment pipelines and credentials?
   - What encryption will protect configuration and secrets?
   - How will you implement least-privilege access during deployment?
   - What security scanning will validate deployment artifacts?

2. **Scalability Impact:**
   - How will you manage deployments across multiple customer domains?
   - What blue-green deployment strategies will ensure zero downtime?
   - How will you handle database migrations during deployment?
   - What auto-scaling will accommodate traffic growth?

3. **Integration Impact:**
   - How will you coordinate deployments with dependent services?
   - What feature flags will enable gradual rollouts?
   - How will you manage API versioning during updates?
   - What rollback strategies will minimize integration disruptions?

4. **Intelligence Impact:**
   - How will you deploy ML models for anomaly detection?
   - What A/B testing will validate new intelligence features?
   - How will you monitor feature performance post-deployment?
   - What feedback loops will improve intelligence algorithms?

5. **Operational Impact:**
   - How will you monitor deployment health and success?
   - What alerting will notify of deployment issues?
   - How will you manage configuration across environments?
   - What documentation will support operational maintenance?

**Deliverables:**
- Automated deployment pipelines for all environments
- Infrastructure as Code configurations
- Deployment validation and monitoring dashboards
- Rollback procedures and disaster recovery plans
- Operational runbooks and maintenance guides

**Constraints:**
- Must achieve zero-downtime deployments
- Should complete deployment in <15 minutes
- Must maintain 99.9% uptime during and after deployment
- Should support instant rollback to previous version
