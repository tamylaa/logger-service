   - How will you monitor resource utilization and scaling needs?
   - What performance metrics will predict capacity requirements?
   - How will you track user growth and usage patterns?
   - What alerting will prevent performance degradation?

3. **Integration Impact:**
   - How will you monitor cross-service dependencies and health?
   - What metrics will validate integration reliability?
   - How will you track API usage and performance?
   - What alerting will detect integration failures?

4. **Intelligence Impact:**
   - How will you monitor the accuracy of categorization and triaging?
   - What metrics will measure the effectiveness of anomaly detection?
   - How will you track user satisfaction with insights?
   - What feedback loops will improve AI algorithms?

5. **Business Impact:**
   - How will you measure the business value of logging insights?
   - What KPIs will track impact on development productivity?
   - How will you monitor customer satisfaction and retention?
   - What analytics will support product roadmap decisions?
