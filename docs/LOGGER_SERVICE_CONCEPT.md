# Logger Service Concept Documentation

## Overview
A domain-specific logging service deployed on Cloudflare for each customer domain (e.g., logger.tamyla.com, logger.wetechfounders.com). The service receives error messages, categorizes them by endpoint, and uses accumulated logs to understand and improve system state.

## Key Features

### Smart Triaging
- **Severity-Based Actions**: Automatically respond to log severity levels
  - Critical: Immediate alerts, service restarts
  - Warning: Escalation notifications
  - Info/Debug: Aggregation for analysis
- **Root Cause Determination**: Pattern matching to identify common issues
- **Proactive Improvements**: Suggest fixes based on log patterns

### Granular Categorization
- **Environment**: development, staging, production
- **Source Type**: UI, logic, backend
- **Error Type**: error vs exception
- **Functional Component**: Specific service/component (e.g., AuthValidator, DataService)
- **Endpoint**: API route or UI path where error occurred

### Multi-Level Analysis
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Immediate categorization and alerting
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend identification and anomaly detection
- **Proactive Insights**: Automated suggestions for system improvements

### Data Flow
1. **Ingestion**: Receive logs via POST requests
2. **Validation**: Authenticate and validate log payloads
3. **Processing**: Categorize and enrich log data
4. **Storage**: Persist logs with appropriate retention
5. **Analysis**: Real-time and batch processing for insights
6. **Actions**: Trigger alerts, webhooks, or automated responses

## Reused Patterns from Existing Services

### From Auth Service
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT validation and session handling
- **Error Response Standardization**: Consistent error formats
- **Health Check Patterns**: Detailed service health monitoring
- **Data Service Integration**: API client patterns for cross-service communication

### From Data Service
- **Webhook Handlers**: Callback processing and validation
- **Database Client Patterns**: Robust error handling and retry logic
- **Migration and Schema Management**: Structured data organization
- **API Response Formatting**: Standardized success/error responses

### From Content Skimmer
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config with validation
- **Logger Implementation**: Structured logging with levels and context
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and health monitoring
